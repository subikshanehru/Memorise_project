The Memorise App is designed to help users efficiently organize and manage their daily tasks. It enables users to set reminders, categorize tasks, and track their productivity through an intuitive interface.
### Task Planner Module

- Allows users to edit and update existing tasks.
- Enables users to delete tasks once they are completed.
- The title bar includes a home icon for easy navigation back to the home screen.
### Task Reminder Module
- Helps users set reminders for their tasks.

- Once the specified time interval is reached, the reminder triggers an alert and automatically terminates after completion.
